## Synopsis

A simple set of ReactJS components that can be used to create grids and other layouts in a webpage. This is a personal project to help me learn both CSS Grid and 
the process for publishing an NPM module.

## Code Example

coming soon...

## Motivation

In some personal React projects I really enjoyed using [Reflexbox](https://github.com/jxnblk/reflexbox) as a way to provide layout for my apps. However, for more complicated
use I found the system based on flexbox to be lacking, since it is only really designed to handle layout in one dimension at a time. It was often necessary to deeply nest
components to get the layout I wanted. I decided that a set of layout components based on CSS grid would better fit my needs. This also served as an oppurtunity to teach me the 
process of publishing an npm module.

## Installation

If you use npm you can install the components with

`npm install --save grif-layout`

Yarn users can run

`yarn add grif-layout`

## API Reference

There are two componenets, Layout and Item. Layout is designed to take multiple Item components as children.

## License
